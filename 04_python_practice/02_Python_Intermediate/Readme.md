# ⚡ Python Intermediate

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that build on **Python Basics** and prepare you for real-world data engineering tasks: clean control flow with exceptions, efficient iteration with iterators/generators, functional patterns (`lambda`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`), and performance profiling/optimization.

> 💻 You’ll commit your progress and submit via **PR** using the Day-3 Git workflow.

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn

* **Error Handling & Robust Code** – `try/except/else/finally`, custom exceptions, and context managers  
* **Iterators & Generators** – memory-efficient pipelines and lazy evaluation  
* **Functional Patterns** – `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and when to prefer comprehensions  
* **Performance Optimization** – measure first (time & memory), profile, and apply targeted improvements  

---

## 📝 Prerequisites

* Completion of **Python Basics** (numbers, strings, `if/else`, loops, lists/sets/dicts, functions)  
* Python **3.11.x** in a project **venv**, selected as your Jupyter kernel (see `02_Installation_and_setup/`)  

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Open this folder in **VS Code** or **JupyterLab**  
2. Ensure your **virtual environment** is active and selected as the kernel  
3. Open a notebook and run cells with **Shift + Enter**  

> 💡 **Tip:** Commit early and often (e.g., per notebook section). Always **Restart Kernel → Run All** before committing.

## 📚 Notebooks (Recommended Order)

1. [Error Handling in Python](./Error_Handling_in_python.ipynb)  
2. [Iterators and Generators](./Iterators_and_generators.ipynb)  
3. [Lambda, Map, Filter, Reduce](./Lambda_Map_Filter_Reduce.ipynb)  
4. [Performance Optimization in Python](./Performance_Optimization_in_python.ipynb)  

---

## 🛠 Exercises

Each notebook has a corresponding **Exercises/** subfolder:

* `Exercises/Error_Handling_in_python_exercises.md`  
* `Exercises/Iterators_and_generators_exercises.md`  
* `Exercises/Lambda_Map_Filter_Reduce_exercises.md`  
* `Exercises/Performance_Optimization_in_python_exercises.md`  

> ✅ Complete exercises **after each notebook section**, then push your branch and open a PR.

---

## 📝 Submission Notes

* Keep each solution **pure** where possible  
* Add micro-benchmarks (`%timeit`) and short comments explaining *why* an optimization helps  
* Ensure notebooks **Restart & Run All** cleanly before committing/PR
