    "##  6. Introduction to Generators & Iterators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, many tasks involve **repeating a process over a collection of data**—this is known as **iteration**. Whether you're looping through a list of names or calculating square numbers, understanding **iterators** and **generators** is essential for writing efficient, Pythonic code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Iteration?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration** is the process of executing a block of code repeatedly—typically using loops like `for` or `while`.  \n",
    "If a loop runs 6 times, we say the block **iterated 6 times**. Behind the scenes, Python makes this work using **iterators** and **iterable objects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Iterators in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **iterator** is an object that allows you to traverse through all the elements of a **collection (like lists, tuples, sets, etc.)**, **one item at a time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Implements** two methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.\n",
    "- Uses **lazy evaluation**: values are computed only when requested.\n",
    "- Efficient for handling **large datasets**, since it doesn't load everything into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Built-in Iterator Functions:**\n",
    "- `iter()` – Converts an iterable (e.g., list, string) into an iterator.\n",
    "- `next()` – Fetches the next item from an iterator.\n"

    "### **What are Generators in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **generator** is a simpler way to create iterators using a function with the `yield` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators also support **lazy evaluation** and generate values on the fly rather than storing the entire sequence in memory. This makes them ideal for working with **large** or **infinite** sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Advantages of Generators**  \n",
    "- **Memory Efficient:** Doesn't load the entire sequence into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convenient**: Cleaner syntax than implementing an iterator class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Infinite Sequences:** Useful for generating infinite data streams (like Fibonacci numbers, primes, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Differences Between `return` and `yield`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`return`** ends a function entirely.\n",
    "- **`yield`** pauses the function and saves its state, allowing it to resume from where it left off.\n",
